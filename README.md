myDARN is an open-source Python library designed for processing and visualizing SuperDARN data. It extends the functionality of the pyDARN and pyDARNio packages, and additionally provides interfaces for running Radar Software Toolkit (RST) subprocesses directly from Python.

Developed by Ben Tobin at the University of Leicester, Planetary Science Group.
